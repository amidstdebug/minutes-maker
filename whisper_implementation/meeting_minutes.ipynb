    "- For each person listed, include their full name, title, or role within the organization, and their department if applicable. This ensures clarity on who was involved and their capacity.\n",

    "3. **Action Description**:\n",
    "   - For each action item, begin with \"Action:\" followed by a detailed description of the task. This description should be clear and specific, outlining what needs to be done. Avoid vague language to ensure that the action can be executed without additional clarification.\n",
